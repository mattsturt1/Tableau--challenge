The first Dashboard shows a map of a breakdown fo the most visited zips stations by Zip Code. This can visualize that a large portion of ride are started in manhattan and in conjunction with later visualizations, can create context for where the majority of the riders begin their rides. Also, seen to the right side, is the top locations for electric bike trips. This small visual provides context that the location discrepencies exist and that will be a part of the story analysis.

The Second Dashboard shows, similarly to the first one, the end locations and zip codes of those stations. This creates a encapsulating picture with the first Dashboard to round off the trips and the popularity of their locations 

The third Dashboard breaks down the differences in hours in popularity between casual members (those without a subscription) and members. A noticible trend in the color coded square visual is that members are more likely than casual riders to ride to work (morning hours), while both casual riders and members alike enjoy a late afternoon ride to work. this may have something to do with the data being from a summer month, and means only those who frequent riding to work in the morning are able to do what is necessary to be prepared at work after a physical activity. thus, a reccomendation is that the stations that are most popular to casual riders should offer more electric powered options, as to ease in the physical demand to ride to work.

Dashboard four shows an analysis on the most popular locations and their breakdowns between electric rentals and standard rentals over the course of the month. These trends can be used with weather data in order to show the best climate to encourage riders, and when a coupon or discount could be offered to incentivized casual riders to purchase a temporary membership.
